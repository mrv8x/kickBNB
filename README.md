# KickBNB

KickBNB is a startup that wants to develop a decentralized app for crowdfunding vacation rentals. This company allows people to advertise one-time vacation rentals for a set price p and number n of guests. 

Anyone interested in staying in a property places a deposit of p/n, which can be can- celed at any time before the reservation is confirmed. After the nth person has signed up, the owner can confirm the reservation, collecting the money in the contract. 

Write a hack that will allow you to steal funds.
